** PROBLEM 2::
part 1:
THE C DATA TYPES FOR NUMERICAL OPERATION AND THEIR VALUE RANGE ARE GIVEN BY:

  int / 2 	–32,767 to 32,767
  float / 4 	1E–37 to 1E+37 with six digits of precision
  double / 8 	1E–37 to 1E+37 with ten digits of precision
  long double / 10 	1E–37 to 1E+37 with ten digits of precision
  long int / 4 	–2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647
  short int / 2 	–32,767 to 32,767
  unsigned short int / 2 	0 to 65,535
  signed short int / 2 	–32,767 to 32,767
  long long int / 8 	–(2power(63) –1) to 2(power)63 –1
  signed long int / 4 	–2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647
  unsigned long int / 4 	0 to 4,294,967,295
  unsigned long long int / 8 	2(power)64 –1
  
 $$ Here the given no: 2147483648 is an integer and hence we can store it using (unsigned long int) or (long long int) or
    (unsigned long long int). Among them (unsigned long int) takes the least space and is sufficient to store the data. So the most 
    preferred data type should be: unsigned long int.
    
 part 2:
  python can store this value in it's integer data type. So to store this no in python we need only (int). Even if we don't specify 
  the data type, it will itself take int as the default data type to store the given no.
